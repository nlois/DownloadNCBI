## DownloadNCBI
#### Download data from genBank
By [Nico Lois](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicolas_Lois) following [NCBI Entrez Utilities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501)

This short workflow allows to download multiple NCBI data through a *nix terminal.
I reccommend going through the bash file `DownloadNCBI_workflow.sh` line by line and check on the commented lines as they may be useful for you.

Please share and report any issues you may find!
